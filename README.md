# ppb-vector
The 2D Vector Class for the PursuedPyBear project.

## Install

You can install `Vector2` pip package using

```bash
pip install 'ppb-vector'
```

## Usage

`Vector2` is an immutable 2D Vector. Instantiated as expected: 

    >>>> from ppb_vector import Vector2
    >>> Vector2(3, 4)
    Vector2(3, 4)

Implements many convenience features:

### Unpacking

    >>> x, y = *Vector(1, 3)
    >>> print(x)
    1
    >>> print(y)
    3
    
### Addition

    >>> Vector2(1, 0) + Vector2(0, 1)
    Vector2(1, 1)

In addition to `Vector2` addition also accepts vector-like objects such as
`tuple`, `list`, and `dict`.

    >>> Vector2(1, 1) + [1, 3]
    Vector2(2, 4)

    >>> Vector2(1, 1) + (2, 4)
    Vector2(3, 5)

    >>> Vector2(1, 1) + {"x": 3, "y": 5}
    Vector2(4, 6)

### Subtraction

    >>> Vector2(3, 3) - Vector2(1, 1)
    Vector2(2, 2)

As with addition, subtraction also takes vector-like objects.

    >>> Vector2(3, 3) - [2, 1]
    Vector2(1, 2)
    
    >>> Vector2(3, 3) - (2, 1)
    Vector2(1, 2)
    
    >>> Vector2(3, 3) - {"x": 2, "y": 1}
    Vector2(1, 2)


### Equality

Vectors are equal if their members are equal.

    >>> Vector2(1, 0) == Vector2(0, 1)
    False

### Scalar Multiplication

Multiply a `Vector2` by a scalar to get a scaled `Vector2`

    >>> Vector2(1, 1) * 3
    Vector2(3, 3)

### Dot Product

Multiply a `Vector2` by another `Vector2` to get the dot product.

    >>> Vector2(1, 1) * Vector2(-1, -1)
    -2

### Vector Length

    >>> Vector2(45, 60).length
    75.0

### Access Values

Convenient access to `Vector2` members via dot notation, indexes, or keys.

    >>> my_vector = Vector2(2, 3)
    >>> my_vector.x
    2
    >>> my_vector[1]
    3
    >>> my_vector["x"]
    2

Also iterable for translation between Vector2 and other sequence types.

    >>> tuple(Vector(2, 3))
    (2, 3)

### Methods

Useful functions for game development.

#### rotate(deg)

Rotate a vector in relation to its own origin and return a new `Vector2`.

    >>> Vector2(1, 0).rotate(90)
    Vector2(0.0, 1.0)

Positive rotation is counter/anti-clockwise.

#### normalize()

Return the normalized `Vector2` for the given `Vector2`.

    >>> Vector2(5, 5).normalize()
    Vector2(0.7071067811865475, 0.7071067811865475)

#### truncate(scalar)

Scale a given `Vector2` to length of `scalar`.

    >>> Vector2(700, 500).truncate(5)
    Vector2(4.068667356033675, 2.906190968595482)

Note that `Vector2.normalize()` is equivalent to `Vector2.truncate(1)`.

    >>> Vector2(200, 300).normalize()
    Vector2(0.5547001962252291, 0.8320502943378436)
    >>> Vector2(200, 300).scale(1)
    Vector2(0.5547001962252291, 0.8320502943378436)

#### scale(scalar)

Scale given `Vector2` to length of `scalar`.

    >>> Vector2(7, 7).scale(5)
    Vector2(3.5355339059327373, 3.5355339059327373)

Note that `Vector2.scale()` is equivalent to `Vector2.truncate()` when `scalar` is
less than length.

    >>> Vector2(3, 4).scale(4)
    Vector2(2.4000000000000004, 3.2)
    >>> Vector2(3, 4).truncate(4)
    Vector2(2.4000000000000004, 3.2)
    >>> Vector2(3, 4).scale(6)
    Vector2(3.5999999999999996, 4.8)
    >>> Vector2(3, 4).truncate(6)
    Vector2(3, 4)
